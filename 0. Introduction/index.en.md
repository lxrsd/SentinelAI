The fundamental challenge for small and medium-sized business (SMB) in AWS security stems from the critical shortage of security expertise and the complexity of implementing comprehensive security controls across multiple domains.

This scenario typically unfolds when SMBs, recognizing their security obligations, enable services like GuardDuty, Security Hub, or Config because they're following general best practices or compliance requirements. However, merely activating these services doesn't automatically improve security posture - it's akin to installing a sophisticated home security system but never monitoring the alerts or properly configuring the sensors.

By leveraging Kiro CLI and the available features, SMBs can transform their security operations across five key areas:

## 1. Discovery
Kiro CLI performs comprehensive account scanning while integrating with MCP servers to analyze existing security configurations, identify gaps, and suggest improvements based on AWS best practices and your specific workload requirements. This automated discovery process reveals security blind spots that manual reviews often miss.

## 2. Investigation
Using Kiro CLI's natural language capabilities combined with MCP's security context awareness, organizations can understand security findings in plain language, evaluate their business impact, and receive prioritized recommendations for remediation. Complex security events become actionable insights.

## 3. Planning
Kiro CLI generates strategic security improvement plans tailored to SMB constraints, considering budget limitations, technical expertise, and business priorities. MCP servers provide validated security architectures and implementation roadmaps that align with industry best practices.

## 4. Remediation
Kiro CLI creates ready-to-use commands, Terraform, CloudFormation templates, or scripts while MCP servers handle the secure execution of remediation tasks, ensuring consistent and documented security improvements across your environment. Implementation becomes systematic rather than ad-hoc.

## 5. Prevention
As your business grows, Kiro CLI and MCP integration provides automated security monitoring, continuous compliance validation, and adaptable security controls that scale with your infrastructure changes. Proactive security measures prevent issues before they become incidents.

This approach addresses both the expertise shortage and the challenge of implementing comprehensive security controls by providing automated, intelligent assistance through Kiro CLI's capabilities while maintaining security through MCP's controlled execution environment. The solution grows smarter over time through machine learning and can adapt to each organization's unique security landscape.
