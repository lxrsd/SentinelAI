weight: 0
---

Learn to implement enterprise-level security for SMBs using AWS tools, Model Context Protocol (MCP), and AI automation. Move from reactive security management to proactive, systematic practices using Kiro CLI and proven crisis response methodologies.

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with AWS services (EC2, S3, IAM)
- Understanding of fundamental security concepts
- No prior experience with Kiro CLI or MCP required

## Who should attend?

**Primary Audience:**
- DevOps Engineers and Cloud Engineers managing AWS infrastructure
- IT Managers and Technical Leaders overseeing SMB security strategy  
- Developers integrating security into development workflows

**Perfect for teams that:**
- Need enterprise-level protection without dedicated security specialists
- Want to move from reactive "firefighting" to proactive security management
- Must demonstrate security compliance to customers or investors

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

- Apply a five-phase security methodology (Discovery, Investigation, Planning, Remediation, Prevention) to AWS security challenges
- Build systematic security response processes using Kiro CLI and AI analysis
- Implement cost-effective security controls that scale with business growth
- Leverage MCP and AI tools to accelerate security operations

## Which AWS Regions can I use?

This workshop runs in **us-east-1 (N. Virginia)** region.

## Will this cost me anything?

Running this workshop in your own AWS account will incur minimal costs (typically under $10). Follow the cleanup instructions at the end of each module to avoid unnecessary charges.

## How much time does it take?

Approximately **1 hour** per adventure:
- Setup and Configuration
- Infrastructure Protection  
- Identity and Access Management
- Application Security
- Data Security

Each module can be completed independently.

## What will I learn?

**Infrastructure Protection**: Secure AWS foundations with network controls, monitoring, and compliance.

**Identity and Access Management**: Implement access controls, detect privilege escalation, maintain least-privilege.

**Application Security**: Protect applications from vulnerabilities while maintaining development velocity.

**Data Security**: Prevent breaches, implement encryption policies, respond to security crises.

**AI-Powered Operations**: Use Kiro CLI and MCP to accelerate security analysis and automation.
